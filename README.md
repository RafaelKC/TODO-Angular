[TODOAngular](https://github.com/RafaelKC/TODO-Angular) is a simple application for creating to-do lists, with tasks categorized by "To Do," "Doing," and "Done" statuses. This was my first project in Angular, which I developed for an internship application. I was accepted, and it became my first professional programming experience! I learned Angular through [Loiane Groner](https://www.linkedin.com/in/loiane/)'s [Angular Course](https://loiane.training/curso/angular).

Later, I built a .NET backend for the application, as initially, all data was stored in JSON files.
